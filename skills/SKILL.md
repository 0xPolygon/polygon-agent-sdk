name: Polygon Agent
description: "Complete Polygon agent toolkit for on-chain operations on Polygon. Use this skill whenever helping an agent set up a wallet, check balances, send or swap tokens, bridge assets, deposit or withdraw from yield (Aave aTokens, ERC-4626 vaults), register on-chain identity, submit or query reputation/feedback, or make x402 micropayments. Covers the full lifecycle: Sequence smart contract wallets, Trails DeFi actions, ERC-8004 identity + reputation, x402 payments. Single CLI entry point (`polygon-agent`), AES-256-GCM encrypted storage."

# Polygon Agentic CLI

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Install globally: `npm install -g @polygonlabs/agent-cli` (reinstall to update)
- Entry point: `polygon-agent <command>`
- Storage: `~/.polygon-agent/` (AES-256-GCM encrypted)

## If a command fails with "Unknown argument" or "command not found"

This skill is versioned with the CLI — commands and flags drift across releases. Check your version, compare to latest, and upgrade if behind:

```bash
polygon-agent --version                        # currently installed
npm view @polygonlabs/agent-cli version        # latest published
npm install -g @polygonlabs/agent-cli@latest   # upgrade
```

## Architecture

| Wallet | Created by | Purpose | Fund? |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| EOA | `setup` | Auth with Sequence Builder | NO |
| Ecosystem Wallet | `wallet create` | Primary spending wallet | YES |

## Environment Variables

### Access key — one key, many names

`SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY`, `SEQUENCE_INDEXER_ACCESS_KEY`, and `TRAILS_API_KEY` are **all the same key** — the Sequence project access key created during `setup`. The CLI treats them as aliases and falls back through all of them automatically.

After `setup` runs the key is stored in `~/.polygon-agent/builder.json`. Every CLI invocation bootstraps it into the environment — no `export` is needed. In a fresh agent session with no environment variables set, simply run commands and the CLI reads credentials from disk.

Only set these manually to override the stored value (e.g. to point at a different project):
```bash
export SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY=<key>  # also covers TRAILS_API_KEY and indexer calls
```

### Optional overrides
| Variable | Default |
|----------|---------|
| `SEQUENCE_ECOSYSTEM_CONNECTOR_URL` | `https://agentconnect.polygon.technology` |
| `SEQUENCE_DAPP_ORIGIN` | Same as connector URL origin |
| `TRAILS_TOKEN_MAP_JSON` | Token-directory lookup |
| `POLYGON_AGENT_DEBUG_FETCH` | Off — logs HTTP to `~/.polygon-agent/fetch-debug.log` |
| `POLYGON_AGENT_DEBUG_FEE` | Off — dumps fee options to stderr |

## Complete Setup Flow

```bash
# Step 1: Setup (creates EOA + Sequence project, stores access key to disk)
polygon-agent setup --name "MyAgent"
# → saves privateKey (not shown again), eoaAddress, accessKey to ~/.polygon-agent/builder.json
# → all subsequent commands auto-load the access key from disk — no export needed

# Step 2: Create ecosystem wallet (opens browser, waits for 6-digit code)
polygon-agent wallet create --usdc-limit 100 --native-limit 5
# → opens https://agentconnect.polygon.technology/link?rid=<rid>&...
# → user approves in browser, browser shows a 6-digit code
# → enter the 6-digit code in the terminal when prompted
# → session saved to ~/.polygon-agent/wallets/main.json
# → notify the user and send them to https://agentconnect.polygon.technology/?rid=<rid>
#   so they can fund their wallet with access to the session

# Step 3: Fund wallet
polygon-agent fund
# → reads walletAddress from session, builds Trails widget URL with toAddress=<walletAddress>
# → ALWAYS run this command to get the URL — never construct it manually or hardcode any address
# → send the returned `fundingUrl` to the user; `walletAddress` in the output confirms the recipient

# Step 4: Verify balances
polygon-agent balances

# Step 5: Register agent on-chain (ERC-8004, Polygon mainnet only)
polygon-agent agent register --name "MyAgent" --broadcast
# → mints ERC-721 NFT, emits Registered event containing agentId
# → retrieve agentId: open the tx on https://polygonscan.com, go to Logs tab,
#   find the Registered event — agentId is the first indexed parameter
# → use agentId for reputation queries, reviews, and feedback
```

## Commands Reference

### Setup
```bash
polygon-agent setup --name <name> [--force]
```

### Wallet
Valid `--chain` values: `polygon` (default/mainnet), `amoy` (Polygon testnet), `mainnet` (Ethereum), `arbitrum`, `optimism`, `base`. ERC-8004 agent operations only support `polygon`.

```bash
polygon-agent wallet create [--name <n>] [--chain polygon] [--timeout <sec>] [--print-url]
  [--native-limit <amt>] [--usdc-limit <amt>] [--usdt-limit <amt>]
  [--token-limit <SYM:amt>]  # repeatable
  [--usdc-to <addr> --usdc-amount <amt>]  # one-off scoped transfer
  [--contract <addr>]  # whitelist contract (repeatable)
polygon-agent wallet import --code <6-digit-code> --rid <rid> [--name <n>]
polygon-agent wallet import --ciphertext '<blob>|@<file>' [--name <n>]  # legacy
polygon-agent wallet list
polygon-agent wallet address [--name <n>]
polygon-agent wallet remove [--name <n>]
```

### Operations
```bash
polygon-agent balances [--wallet <n>] [--chain <chain>] [--chains <csv>]
polygon-agent send --to <addr> --amount <num> [--symbol <SYM>] [--token <addr>] [--decimals <n>] [--broadcast]
polygon-agent send-native --to <addr> --amount <num> [--broadcast] [--direct]
polygon-agent send-token --symbol <SYM> --to <addr> --amount <num> [--token <addr>] [--decimals <n>] [--broadcast]
polygon-agent swap --from <SYM> --to <SYM> --amount <num> [--to-chain <chain>] [--slippage <num>] [--broadcast]
polygon-agent deposit --asset <SYM> --amount <num> [--protocol aave|morpho] [--broadcast]
polygon-agent withdraw --position <addr> --amount <num|max> [--chain <chain>] [--broadcast]
polygon-agent fund [--wallet <n>] [--token <addr>]
polygon-agent x402-pay --url <url> --wallet <n> [--method GET] [--body <str>] [--header Key:Value]
```

### Agent (ERC-8004)
```bash
polygon-agent agent register --name <n> [--agent-uri <uri>] [--metadata <k=v,k=v>] [--broadcast]
polygon-agent agent wallet --agent-id <id>
polygon-agent agent metadata --agent-id <id> --key <key>
polygon-agent agent reputation --agent-id <id> [--tag1 <tag>] [--tag2 <tag>]
polygon-agent agent reviews --agent-id <id> [--tag1 <t>] [--tag2 <t>] [--revoked]
polygon-agent agent feedback --agent-id <id> --value <score> [--tag1 <t>] [--tag2 <t>] [--endpoint <e>] [--feedback-uri <uri>] [--broadcast]
```

**ERC-8004 contracts (Polygon mainnet):**
- IdentityRegistry: `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`
- ReputationRegistry: `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`

## Key Behaviors

- **Dry-run by default** — all write commands require `--broadcast` to execute
- **Smart defaults** — `--wallet main`, `--chain polygon`, auto-wait on `wallet create`
- **`balances --chains`** — comma-separated chains (max 20); two or more return JSON with `multiChain: true` and a `chains` array (same wallet address on each)
- **Fee preference** — auto-selects USDC over native POL when both available
- **`fund`** — returns `https://wallet.polygon.technology` as the `fundingUrl`. Always run `polygon-agent fund` to get the URL and wallet address — never hardcode or construct manually.
- **`deposit`** — picks highest-TVL pool via Trails `getEarnPools` and deposits directly. If the session rejects the call, re-create the wallet with `--contract <tokenAddress> --contract <depositAddress>` (the dry-run output shows both addresses). Full deposit reference: https://agentconnect.polygon.technology/polygon-defi/SKILL.md
- **`withdraw`** — `--position` = aToken or ERC-4626 vault; `--amount` = `max` or underlying units (Aave / vault). Dry-run JSON includes `poolAddress` / `vault`. Broadcast needs session on the **same chain** as `--chain`, with pool/vault + underlying token whitelisted where the relayer touches them
- **`x402-pay`** — probes endpoint for 402, smart wallet funds builder EOA with exact token amount, EOA signs EIP-3009 payment. Chain auto-detected from 402 response
- **`send-native --direct`** — bypasses ValueForwarder contract for direct EOA transfer
- **Session permissions** — without `--usdc-limit` etc., session gets bare-bones defaults and may not transact
- **Session expiry** — 6 months from creation

## Wallet Creation Flow (v2 Relay)

`wallet create` uses a Cloudflare Durable Object relay and a 6-digit out-of-band code — no cloudflared tunnel required. The browser encrypts the approved session with an X25519 key negotiated via the relay; the 6-digit code is the decryption key entered in the terminal.

**`--print-url` flag:** Use this in headless or non-interactive environments (CI, remote shells) where `wallet create` can't block waiting for the code. The CLI prints the approval URL and exits immediately. Complete the flow separately:
```bash
polygon-agent wallet import --code <6-digit-code> --rid <rid>
```

## CRITICAL: Wallet Approval URL

When `wallet create` outputs a URL in the `url` or `approvalUrl` field, send the **complete, untruncated URL** to the user. The URL contains the relay request ID required for session approval.

- Do NOT shorten, summarize, or add `...` to the URL
- Do NOT split the URL across multiple messages
- Output the raw URL exactly as returned by the CLI

## Presenting Results to the User

CLI commands output JSON (non-TTY). After running a command, always render the result as formatted markdown — never paste raw JSON into the conversation.

| Command | How to present |
|---------|---------------|
| `balances` | Markdown table: Token / Balance columns. Show wallet address and chain above the table. |
| `send` / `send-token` / `send-native` | One-liner summary: amount, symbol, recipient. If broadcast, show tx hash as a code span and explorer URL as a link. |
| `swap` | Summary: `X FROM → Y TO` with chain. If broadcast, show deposit tx hash + explorer link. |
| `deposit` | Summary: amount, asset, protocol, pool address. If broadcast, show tx hash + explorer link. |
| `withdraw` | Summary: `kind` (aave / erc4626), position, amount, pool or vault. If broadcast, show tx hash + explorer link. |
| `fund` | Show the `fundingUrl` as a clickable link with a brief instruction to open it. |
| `wallet create` / `wallet list` | Wallet name, truncated address, chain in a small table or bullet list. |
| `agent register` | Show agent name and tx hash as a code span with Polygonscan link. Remind user to retrieve `agentId` from the Registered event on the Logs tab. |
| `agent wallet` | Show `agentId`, wallet address, and whether a wallet is set. |
| `agent metadata` | Show `agentId`, key, and decoded value. |
| `agent reputation` | Format score and tag breakdown as a small table. |

**Dry-run results** — always make it visually clear this was a simulation. Prefix with `⚡ Dry run` and show what *would* happen. Remind the user to re-run with `--broadcast` to execute.

**Errors** — extract the `error` field and present it as a clear sentence, not a JSON blob. Include the relevant fix from the Troubleshooting table if applicable.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `Builder configured already` | Add `--force` |
| `Missing SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY` | Run `setup` first |
| `Missing wallet` | `wallet list`, re-run `wallet create` |
| `Session expired` | Re-run `wallet create` (6-month expiry) |
| `Fee option errors` | Set `POLYGON_AGENT_DEBUG_FEE=1`, ensure wallet has funds |
| `Timed out waiting for wallet approval` | Add `--timeout 600` |
| `Invalid code: hash mismatch` | Wrong 6-digit code entered — retry (3 attempts allowed) |
| `Relay request not found` | Session expired or already used — re-run `wallet create` (or `wallet create --print-url`) |
| Deposit session rejected | Re-create wallet with `--contract <tokenAddress> --contract <depositAddress>` (both required: token approve + pool call) |
| `withdraw` / broadcast: wrong chain or session rejects | Use `wallet create --chain <same as --chain>` and `--contract` for pool/vault + underlying ERC-20 on that chain; omit tight `--usdc-limit` if it blocks fee transfers |
| `Stored explicit session is missing pk` | Re-link: `wallet import --code …` after `wallet create` |
| Wrong recipient in Trails widget | Run `polygon-agent fund` (do not construct the URL manually) |
| `x402-pay`: no 402 response | Endpoint doesn't require x402 payment, or URL is wrong |
| `x402-pay`: payment token mismatch | Chain/token in the 402 response differs from wallet — check `--wallet` points to the right chain |
| `x402-pay`: EOA funding failed | Wallet lacks sufficient balance to cover the payment amount — run `balances` and fund if needed |
